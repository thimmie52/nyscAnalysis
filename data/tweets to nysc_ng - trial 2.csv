Ekiti Lacks Decisive Governance in Gov Oyebanji: Case Study NYSC Orientation Camp Toilet Facilities Reconstruction, But Non commissioning.

Recall the much media celebrated approval of the construction of the collapsed toilet facilities at the Ekiti NYSC Camp by Oyebanji's media circus of deception?

https://t.co/tyoyIo18eI

""Gov. Oyebanji Orders Immediate Construction Of Toilet Facilities At NYSC Orientation Camp""

Well an update from the NYSC camp from Ekiti citizen, Prince Busayo Ademiku reveals that despite the completion of these toilet facilities, the corp members are still forced to baths and use nearby bushes for nature call as the toilet facilities remain under lock and key.

The Order is that the facilities will not be accessible until governor Oyebanji deems fit to commission.

The government media team's strategy is clear, maximize media hype on any and every little commissioning exercise!!!

This open air defecation is actually a crime in Ekiti law, so why is the governor criminalizing these future leaders?"
