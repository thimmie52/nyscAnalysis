2.Transform it into a compulsory one-year military service. Let graduates serve as professionals within the armed forces‚Äîlearning discipline, leadership, and defense. At least that way, we won‚Äôt keep panicking at the sight of barely-educated soldiers on the streets.

3.Reform it into a one-year mandatory vocational training. Engage corpers in manufacturing, skilled trades, and craftsmanship. Equip them with practical skills beyond theory.

4.Redirect it into agricultural service. Let corpers spend a year in the farmers contributing to national food production, aiming to supply at least 30% of the country‚Äôs needs.

With any of these four options, corpers will emerge more equipped to face the real world‚Äîarmed with more than just a degree and better prepared to explore diverse paths to livelihood.

On April 19, 1969 ‚Äî just 21 months into Nigeria‚Äôs 30-month-long Civil War ‚Äî General Yakubu Gowon, then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, stood smiling as he cut a lavish wedding cake with his bride, Victoria Zakari. At that very moment, thousands of young Nigerian soldiers lay in trenches, bleeding, fighting, dying. Families were wailing across the land, homes shattered by bullets and bombs. And yet, the man who was supposed to embody national sacrifice and unity ‚Äî the man whose troops were dying in his name ‚Äî was tying the knot in style and basking in marital pleasure in Dodan Barracks.

What sort of leadership celebrates a honeymoon in the heat of national agony?

Rather than stand at the frontlines, rallying troops and shouldering the burden of war like true wartime commanders do, Gowon chose comfort, luxury, and personal bliss. His decision wasn‚Äôt just poor timing ‚Äî it was an insult to the very souls that were perishing under his command. It was a show of moral detachment, professional negligence, and a shocking absence of empathy for a nation in crisis.

But it doesn‚Äôt end there.

After the war, Gowon launched the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) ‚Äî an initiative supposedly designed to ‚Äúfoster unity‚Äù and ‚Äúrebuild national identity.‚Äù Instead, it became a state-sanctioned endurance exercise, throwing fresh graduates into distant regions with little preparation, poor support, and a forced ideology of patriotism that many no longer believe in.

Let‚Äôs be honest: the NYSC is not a shared national experience. For some, it is an adventure ‚Äî fun, light work, connections, and a gateway to opportunity. For others, it is a year of trauma, suffering, poor pay, dangerous assignments, sexual harassment, hunger, and meaningless toil. Many serve in regions they barely understand, risking their lives in unsafe areas, with no protection ‚Äî all for a certificate that increasingly holds little weight in today‚Äôs job market.

Gowon‚Äôs decision to start NYSC was not born of selflessness but of guilt, image management, and an attempt to rewrite the narrative of his wartime failures. It is a glorified punishment passed down from one generation of Nigerian leadership to another. And the Nigerian youth ‚Äî intelligent, ambitious, and increasingly disillusioned ‚Äî have paid the price.

Let us be very clear: the NYSC has outlived whatever usefulness it might have once claimed. It is a burden, not a benefit. It is a remnant of a hypocritical legacy, built by a man who asked others to die for a country while he feasted, married, and honeymooned in luxury.

To the Nigerian youth: question everything. Don‚Äôt be guilt-tripped by slogans of unity from leaders who‚Äôve never known sacrifice. Don‚Äôt take the NYSC as a sacred rite ‚Äî see it for what it truly is: a failed experiment, born from a false vision, sustained by inertia, and in urgent need of scrapping."
