I am a living witness to all the two. I got bigger opportunities after my NYSC with a private organization and I got retained immediately after NYSC. 

I advise the young ones to look beyond big name government organizations as NYSC PPA. Go for medium and big name private organizations. You learn a lot on the job, you get experience, you get post NYSC opportunities and you get high chance of getting retained to start from somewhere.
