This project was born out of a desire to give back to my host community. By donating these bedsheets, I hoped to improve the comfort and hygiene of patients receiving care at the facility.

It was even more special to have my brothers, sisters, friends and fellow corps members present during the donation. Their presence and support meant everything to me. 

I was presented with a Commendation Letter from the in-charge of the PHC in appreciation of the project. This recognition has encouraged me to continue being a vessel of service, no matter how small the act may seem.

I‚Äôve learned that impact doesn‚Äôt always require a big platform, sometimes it just takes a willing heart and a bit of effort.

In a remarkable effort to promote youth empowerment and community development, the NYSC What Next Africa Community Development Service (CDS) Group has successfully organized a dynamic skills acquisition program for students in Ileoluji, Ondo State. The event, which took place at the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Entrepreneurship Center, drew over 100 enthusiastic participants, primarily secondary school students, eager to broaden their horizons and improve their future employability.

The initiative was spearheaded by Corps Members Miss Oma-Wilkie Temisan Utieyin (OD/24B/3262) and Adewumi Idowu Paul (OD/24B/3457), with full support from the What Next Africa CDS Group. Recognizing the urgent need for skill-based education in the community, the group conceptualized and executed the project to address this gap.

The program featured a series of practical workshops designed to impart both entrepreneurial and technical skills vital for personal and professional growth. Areas covered included digital marketing, tailoring, make up, computer literacy, and baking. Each session was facilitated by experienced professionals who provided hands-on training and mentorship, ensuring that participants gained practical, actionable knowledge they could immediately apply.

Speaking at the event, one of the facilitators emphasized the importance of empowering young people with relevant skills in today‚Äôs fast-changing economic landscape: ‚ÄúEducation goes beyond the classroom. Programs like this give students a head start by teaching them how to be self-reliant, creative, and digitally aware.‚Äù

This initiative reflects the NYSC What Next Africa CDS Group‚Äôs unwavering commitment to empowering youth and supporting sustainable development at the grassroots level. By equipping young minds with employable skills, the group is helping to bridge the gap between education and real-world opportunities, particularly in underserved communities.

The program also aligns with the broader objectives of the NYSC scheme, which seeks to foster national unity and development through youth-driven projects and civic engagement.

According to the CDS group coordinator, ‚ÄúOur goal is to create a ripple effect of transformation. By empowering just one young person with a skill, we are setting the stage for broader social and economic impact.‚Äù

We would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Mrs. Carolina Jaiyeola A., our LGI, who has been our guide and mentor. We would also like to thank HRM Oba (Dr.) Oluwole Olufaderin Adetimehin, FIIN, FCIB, Jimoko II, Jegun of Ile-Oluji for his royal endorsement and sponsorship, as well as the director and staff of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Entrepreneurship Center for their collaboration and support in providing a conducive venue.

With initiatives like this, the NYSC What Next Africa CDS Group is building a future where Nigerian youth are not just job seekers, but solution providers, innovators, and leaders of change."

Corps Members serving in Ife South Local Government Area of Osun State have demonstrated their commitment to community development service through two major initiatives focused on empowerment and humanitarian service.

On Tuesday, July 8, 2025, the final match of an Inter-School Female Football Competition was held at Olode Community. The tournament, which began on June 23, 2025, featured seven secondary schools and was spearheaded by Corps Members Akintunde Elijah Olanrewaju (OS/24B/5021) and Adepoju Mutiu Babalola (OS/24B/5029). 

Designed as a Community Development Service (CDS) project, the initiative aimed to provide a platform for female students to display their athletic talents while fostering teamwork and confidence. The event was graced by the Olu of Olode, Oba Yekeen Omisore, alongside community chiefs, school representatives, and residents.

In a separate outreach, Corps Members in Ifetedo community carried out a Charity Service exercise targeting underprivileged individuals. Initiated by Friday Raphael Ukwumaka (OS/24C/2582) and Nkemjika Chiamaka Amarachi (OS/24B/4056), the outreach involved distributing essential food items such as rice, beans, spaghetti, and cooking oil to seven identified beneficiaries in the community. The team, supported by Onikede Waliat (OS/24C/0143) and Ogabi Tolulope (OS/24C/2543), visited each recipient at home, receiving heartfelt gratitude and prayers in return.

Following the outreach, the Corps Members paid a courtesy visit to the palace of His Royal Majesty Oba Akinola Oyetade Akinrera, Latiri I, the Olubosin of Ifetedo Kingdom, where they were warmly received by the chiefs, who lauded their compassion and community spirit.

Dr Akabe used the occasion to announce that the State Government planned to give an official vehicle to the NYSC North-Central II Area Office, Lafia, to enable seamless operations of the Office.

He commended both the Director, NYSC North-Central II Area Office, Mrs Grace Ogbuogebe and the Nasarawa State Coordinator, Hajiya Salamatu Muhammad for their resilience in pursuing the Scheme's interests in the Zone and the State. Akabe described Muhammad as ""two men in one woman"" owing to her proactiveness in addressing the issues of security and welfare of Corps Members in the State.

Dr Akabe, who recounted his experience as a Corps Member in 1985 with nostalgia, said most of his close friends across Nigeria are people he met during his service year in Enugu the capital of the now defunct Anambra State.

While expressing appreciation to the Management of NYSC for choosing Lafia as the venue for 2025 Batch 'B' Pre-Orientation Workshop, the Acting Governor enjoined the participants to take some time to experience and enjoy the serene environment and hospitality of the State.

The Director General of NYSC informed his host that members of NYSC top management, State Coordinators, Camp Directors and Camp Commandant designates, as well as representatives of the Police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Red Cross Society, Federal Fire Service, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, National Health Insurance Authority and Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre had converged in Lafia for the Workshop.

He explained that the workshop was an avenue through which the stakeholders reviewed previous Orientation Exercise, with a view to charting a new course for the forthcoming exercise.

The NYSC helmsman lauded the State Government for its consistent support to NYSC's general operations. He expressed appreciation for the facelift being given to the Magaji Dan-Yamusa Nasarawa State NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp in Keffi, especially the ongoing construction of a gigantic multipurpose hall.

Brigadier General Nafiu reaffirmed NYSC's commitment to nation building, through the deployment of skilled graduates to offer free services to all sectors of the nation's economy.

""We inject a minimum of 1,000 teachers to the education sector of every State of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory during each of the six streams of service year, annually. We equally distribute medical personnel, engineers, lawyers, accountants, psychologists and all other categories of professionals in like manner, and we are poised to do more"", he added."

By; Ismail Jimoh 
Saturday, 12 July, 2025.

In a show of civic responsibility and environmental consciousness, NYSC corps members serving under the 7 Division, Nigerian Army, Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri, carried out a sanitation exercise around the officers‚Äô quarters in the cantonment earlier today. The exercise was part of their Community Development Service (CDS) and aimed at promoting a cleaner, healthier environment within the military community.

The corps members, who were visibly happy and enthusiastic throughout the activity as captured in the visuals engaged passionately in clearing waste which focused particularly on the removal of non-biodegradable waste, especially plastic materials, which pose long-term environmental hazards due to their resistance to decomposition. By targeting plastic waste which takes hundreds of years to break down the exercise helped raise awareness about the dangers of plastic pollution and the importance of proper waste disposal.

The initiative not only enhanced the sanitary condition of the area but also reinforced the corps members' commitment to national development and sustainable environmental practices. The effort was applauded by residents and military personnel, who praised the corps members for their sense of duty, discipline, and initiative.

Such exercise serve as a bridge between the NYSC and host communities, fostering stronger civil-military relations and encouraging collective responsibility for environmental protection

The Enugu State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Mrs. Oluwakemi Awolola, accompanied by some members of staff, paid a courtesy visit to the Executive Governor of Enugu State, His Excellency Dr. Peter Ndubuisi Mba, on July 10, 2025, at the Government House, Enugu.

The visit commenced with a brief introduction by the Chairman of the NYSC State Governing Board and Hon. Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Barr. Lloyd Ekweremmadu. In her remarks, the State Coordinator expressed sincere appreciation to the Governor for his unwavering support for the welfare of corps members in the state. She particularly commended his administration‚Äôs recent efforts in upgrading infrastructure at the NYSC Orientation Camp in Awgu.

Mrs. Awolola further used the opportunity to present a comprehensive report on the challenges confronting the scheme in the state, with special emphasis on the deplorable condition of facilities at the orientation camp. She presented graphic images to illustrate the state of disrepair and passionately appealed for urgent intervention, describing the Governor as a visionary leader and a result-oriented administrator. She also drew attention to the corps members‚Äô monthly state allowance, which she noted was among the lowest in the country.

In response, Governor Mba acknowledged the significant contributions of NYSC to national development and lauded the scheme's legacy of service and youth empowerment. He expressed concern over the poor state of the camp facilities and immediately directed the Commissioner for Youth and Sports to commence a total renovation of the orientation camp. He assured that the state government would complete the project within three months and, in the interim, advised that the next orientation course be relocated to another venue within the state. He further noted that the renovated camp would also serve as a strategic asset during the forthcoming National Sports Festival to be hosted by Enugu State.

On the issue of corps members‚Äô welfare, the Governor announced a substantial increase in their monthly state allowance. Henceforth, regular corps members will receive ‚Ç¶20,000 monthly, while corps medical doctors will earn ‚Ç¶80,000. Pharmacists will be paid ‚Ç¶60,000, and nurses as well as other corps medical personnel will receive ‚Ç¶40,000 monthly. To ensure prompt implementation, the Governor directed that the Secretary to the State Government be immediately notified.

Governor Mba reaffirmed his administration's commitment to strengthening collaboration with the NYSC, particularly in the area of healthcare delivery. He further pledged to provide an official vehicle for the NYSC State Coordinator, upon learning that the scheme currently operates without one in the state.

In her closing remarks, Mrs. Awolola expressed profound gratitude to the Governor for his unprecedented support and generosity. She assured him of NYSC‚Äôs continued commitment to supporting the developmental agenda of the state and pledged to promptly convey the Governor‚Äôs goodwill message to the Director-General of NYSC, Brigadier General O.O. Nafiu.

The visit was rounded off with a group photograph to commemorate the occasion.

The Medical and Charity CDS groups of Irewole LGA organised a Community Health Awareness and Genotype Testing Outreach on Monday, at Ibran Hotel and Event Centre, Itaakun. The project targeted secondary school students aged 14‚Äì20, focusing on educating them about genotype, blood group, and marriage compatibility.

Ahead of the event, blood samples were collected from interested students across nine schools between July 10 and 11, with parental consent. These samples were analysed at St. Jude Hospital, Ikire. 

The President of the Medical CDS, Okafor Livinus, in his welcome address, highlighted the importance of early awareness of genotype and blood group in health and relationship decisions. Three insightful presentations were delivered by Egbon Orobosa Krystal, Okafor Livinus, and Dr. Habeeb Bolakole Sulaiman on topics ranging from genotype inheritance to blood group relevance and compatibility in relationships. The students engaged actively, asking questions and sharing experiences.

After the educational sessions, students collected their test results and received personalised counselling from medical Corps Members. Light refreshments were served, and appreciation was extended to participating schools and supporters, notably the CEO of Ibran Hotel and NYSC officials.

_Oduduwa Healthcare Foundation Donates Medical Supplies for Corps Members‚Äô Welfare_

As the 2025 Batch B Stream 1 Orientation Course draws near, the NYSC Osun State Coordinator, Mr. Agbor Ndoma Obim, has declared that discipline should be the watchword, urging staff and collaborating agencies to demonstrate greater commitment, integrity, professionalism, and teamwork throughout the exercise.

Agbor made the call during a series of strategic meetings held separately with Heads of Assignments, collaborating agencies, and NYSC staff today at the State Secretariat in Osogbo. This is in preparation for the Orientation Course set to commence on Tuesday, 30th of July, 2025, at the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Ede.

The Coordinator highlighted the importance of upholding the integrity of the NYSC Scheme despite external pressures, warning against acts of extortion, over-socialisation, and poor work ethics. 

He condemned the increasing disregard for morning meditation by Officials and warned that nonattendance will be duly punished in accordance with the Scheme's Orientation guidelines and code of conduct. 

He called for the reorientation of Corps Members returning from relocation or on exeat to ensure they are properly integrated into the programme. 

He emphasised mentorship, diplomacy in handling Corps Members‚Äô issues, and the need for State Governments to improve stipends for Corps Members especially those posted to government schools in order to boost the morale and encourage Corps Members to settle down in their places of Primary Assignments rather than seeking reposting to the capital.

In her brief, the Camp Director, Mrs. Otunla Ronke, echoed the Coordinator‚Äôs message and charged staff to carry out their responsibilities more effectively.

She cautioned against holding any parallel programmes during lectures and SAED and announced that Corps Members would be co-opted into Camp market surveillance to assist in monitoring Camp market activities. This, according to her, is to ensure inclusivity and to enhance positive feedback from the Corps Members.

The Camp Commandant, Capt. SP. Yerima, in his brief called on all security and collaborating agencies to maintain a high standard of professionalism and ensure discipline and safety remain collective priorities.

During the staff meeting, Heads of Branches, Units, and Assignments took turns to brief the house on the progress recorded in their respective offices, outlining expectations and detailing the level of preparedness ahead of the forthcoming Orientation Course.

In his closing remarks, Agbor urged improved staff attendance at morning meditation, emphasised the importance of a clean Camp environment, particularly the toilets and reminded all that the swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for Friday, 1st of August.

In a significant gesture of support, the Oduduwa Healthcare Foundation, Ile-Ife, led by Dr. Samson Ikpekhia, donated essential medical supplies including contraceptives, antibiotics, and antimalarial drugs to the NYSC.

 Dr Ikpekhia, made it known during the donation that the gesture was a way to enhance healthcare delivery and safeguarding of the wellbeing of Corps Members during the Orientation Course.

Receiving the items, the State Coordinator expressed heartfelt appreciation to the Foundation for its timely and thoughtful gesture. He described the donation as a valuable contribution to the health and safety of Corps Members, affirming that it reflects the kind of collaborative spirit needed to strengthen the Scheme. 

He assured that the supplies would be judiciously used and encouraged other organisations to support NYSC in similar impactful ways."

He also charged the Planning Research and Statistics (PRS) Schedule Officers of the Scheme to be proactive in carrying out their responsibilities.

He gave the charge while addressing them at the opening ceremony of a workshop organized for them at new keffi Hotel, Keffi, Nasarawa State.  

General Nafiu urged the officers to take advantage of the workshop and upgrade their knowledge in order to be effective in discharging their duties.

He said the Management would continue to support officers by providing the necessary platforms to enhance their operational capabilities

The NYSC boss also admonished the workshop participants to pay full attention to all lectures in order to aquire new techniques that would propel them to meet up with the expectations and reality in the evolving dynamics of the Scheme.

The Director General who was represented by the Director, Planning Research and Statistics, Dr Ahmed Wada Ikaka also said the workshop was aimed at assembling NYSC PRS Officers from different states of the nation, to refresh their minds on critical policies of the NYSC. 

Earlier, the Director, Planning, Research and Statistics in his welcome address said the department was saddled with the responsibility of planning, coordination, research, data collation and analysis as well as monitoring and evaluation of NYSC programmes and activities nationwide.

Speaking through the Deputy Director Research, Mr Stephen Dewan, Ikaka stated further that the workshop would acquaint officers with requisite knowledge and skills to enhance their job performances."

In a bid to attenuate corrupt practices and ensure compliance with the code of conduct for public officers, officials of the Code of Conduct Bureau, have engaged officials of the NYSC at the NYSC Lagos State Secretariat, on online declaration of assets.

The officials, Dr Ayodeji Fatehinse and Mr Emmanuel Sonuga, enlightened the officials on the need to establish a high standard of morality in the conduct of government business and to ensure that the actions and behaviours of public officers conform to the highest standards of public morality and accountability. They highlighted conflict of interest with duties, restriction on specified officers, prohibition of foreign accounts, retired public officers, gifts or benefits to certain public officers, bribery of public officers, abuse of power, membership of societies, declaration of assets, allegation of breach of code and conflict of interests etc.

They concluded that the code of conduct for public officers should serve as a mechanism for continuous self-assessment by public officers in their efforts to meeting with public expectations, scrutiny and evaluation. They urged officials to promote integrity, anticipate public perception, try to live within their means, have a heightened awareness of statutory provisions and regulations and develop an attitude of compliance, ask for adequate material resources to carry out their assignments among many others.

While giving her remarks during the programme, the State Coordinator NYSC Lagos, Mrs Christiana Salmwang, appreciated the Management of the National Youth Service Corps, for approving such programme for the enlightenment of officials of the scheme. She equally appreciated officials of the Code of Conduct Bereau for the sensitization on the procedural engagement to be given to the declaration of assets. She appealed to them for more simplification of the processes of declaration of assets and co-opting of younger officers into the education process of asset declaration.

The National Youth Service Corps has promised stronger synergy with its critical partners and other stakeholders in the conduct of the Orientation Course and other aspects of the Scheme's operations. 

The Director General of National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier General Olakunle Nafiu stated this today at the Opening Ceremony of the 2025 Batch 'B' Pre-Orientation Workshop held in Lafia, Nasarawa State.

The DG, who said the Pre-Orientation Course workshop served as a platform for NYSC Management and other key stakeholders in the Orientation activities to review the previous Orientation Course added that the goal was to improve NYSC operations for future sessions. 

General Nafiu stated further that, the periodic conduct of Pre-Orientation  workshop was borne out of NYSC Management‚Äôs determination to ensure the continuous improvement of the Orientation Course content with a view to equipping the Corps Members adequately for the enormous task of nation building. 

He said the Orientation Course must continue to serve as a platform for instilling discipline, patriotism, and unity‚Äîvalues that were non-negotiable in nation-building, amid distractions and competing interests.

Nasarawa State Governor, Engr. Abdullahi Sule while declaring open the workshop, with the theme, ""Maintaining the Integrity of the Orientation Course in the face of Competing Interests"", pledged continued support to the NYSC.

He said since the inception of National Youth Service Corps in 1973, the Scheme has been playing a pivotal role in national development, while commending its commendable efforts in community development, healthcare services, public policy awareness, educational interventions, and participation in national exercises such as elections, census among others, which have earned Nigeria accolades both domestically and internationally. 

He described NYSC as a cornerstone of collective aspirations, that needed the support of all stakeholders. A

The Governor, who was represented by his Deputy, Dr Emmanuel Akabe  appreciated the invaluable contributions of Corps Members to the State in healthcare delivery, community development projects, environmental sanitation, and socio-economic services.

""It is crucial that we continue to provide unwavering support to the Scheme, building upon its myriad of achievements across all sectors of national economic development. 

We are dedicated to infrastructural development, creating an enabling environment for our youths to thrive"", the Governor said. 

He urged the Scheme to innovate further on cementing its roles in national development and earning greater admiration from Nigerians.

The Director, Planning Research and Statistics, Dr Ahmed Wada Ikaka in his introductory address said the Orientation Camp being the first point of contact for the Corps Members creates a lasting impression on them, hence, the need to make it a worthwhile and impactful lifetime experience."

You cant currently upload all supporting documents on the portal since you registered as single. Avoid the mistake of reporting to a distant state only to seek redeployment later ( might not work and you start a year of endurance).

 The Director General highlighted that while the NYSC has made strides to update its mobilization process in response to Nigeria‚Äôs evolving educational policies, challenges persist. These include mismatched data from institutions, the upload of unqualified or part-time graduates, technical glitches causing frustrating delays, and attempts to falsify records.

Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar, the Director of Corps Mobilization, emphasized that the workshop serves as a platform for the NYSC, Corps Producing Institutions, and other key stakeholders to come together and enhance the mobilization efforts. Participants are urged to expect the Mobilization table to be released shortly after the workshop, facilitating a smoother mobilization process.

The Director General of National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier General Olakunle Nafiu has said the Scheme would continue to deplore more ICT tools to enhance its mobilisation process.

He said the NYSC would also continue to train its mobilization officers on data verification, error resolution and emergency response, cybersecurity software training for staff handling sensitive data, among others.

He said this was necessary as the number of threats and attacks on the Scheme's mobilization system increased daily. 

General Nafiu stated this today in his keynote address at the 2025 Batch 'B' Pre-Mobilization Workshop with the theme; ""Strengthening the NYSC Mobilisation Process through Improved Technology and Collaboration with Stakeholders, held in Abuja.

He disclosed further that
reforming the NYSC mobilization process had become necessary in the present dispensation, because the society was evolving and the Scheme must adjust its strategies to match current realities. 

""We at NYSC recognize that by leveraging technology, forging stronger partnerships, investing in infrastructure, and deploying relevant skills, we can boost efficiency, enhance the experience of both prospective and serving Corps Members, and maintain the Scheme‚Äôs role in national development.

I therefore urge all our partners and collaborating agencies, particularly the Corps-producing institutions, to speed up the process of technological update to an acceptable level that makes collaboration and partnership seamless and more functional.

Let us not betray that trust. Let us jointly commit to prioritizing integrity over expediency, innovating for efficiency, and collaborating for national progress.
We are on the threshold of transformation. With technology as our tool and collaboration as our compass, we will build a mobilization system that is secure, smart, and truly service-driven"", General Nafiu said.

The Director General also said although the Scheme had attempted to update its mobilization process in line with changes in Nigeria‚Äôs educational policy and environment, it still faced several challenges, including; mismatched data from institutions, uploads of unqualified or part-time graduates, technical glitches that result in frustrating delays, attempts at falsification of records among others.

The Director, Corps Mobilization, Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar said the workshop was an avenue for bringing the NYSC, Corps Producing Institutions and other key stakeholders to brainstorm and improve on the Scheme's mobilization efforts.

He said though the Scheme had made remarkable progress as a result of collaboration, but there was need to tackle fraudulent uploading of unqualified graduates.

""This process is vital for our nation's growth but it is fraught with challenges, especially with dishonest enrollments. We must therefore stay alert and be proactive"", he said.

Alhaji Abubakar urged the participants to be diligent in their assignments with high integrity and ensure they upload accurate information of their prospective Members."
